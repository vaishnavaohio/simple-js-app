# Pokedex
A small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail through a modal. I used a bootstrap framework for formatting the UI


Things to include for portfolio
1) Project description
2) How to get the project running
3) Project dependencies (e.g., JavaScript version, ESLint rules)
4) Which API the project uses
* Write about some difficulties and solutions like how I was able to find the error without using a linter (used repl it)
* why i used jQuery in some areas of code rather than vanilla JS (faster search features)
* used kanban board to keep me on schedule
